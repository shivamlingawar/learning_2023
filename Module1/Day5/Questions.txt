L1 Activities:

1. Use structures to find the volume and the total surface area of the box. 
   You need to access the members of the structure with the help of a structure pointer:
    a. With the help of (*) asterisk or indirection operator and (.) dot operator.
    b. With the help of ( -> ) Arrow operator using pointer as well as dot representation.

2. Write a C program that uses functions to perform the following operations: 
     i) Reading a complex number 
     ii) Writing a complex number 
     iii) Addition of two complex numbers 
     iv) Multiplication of two complex numbers 
  (Note: represent complex number using a structure.

3. Write a program using structures to calculate the difference between two time periods using a user-defined function.

4. write a program to Store Data for n students in Structures Dynamically. 

5. Write a program to demonstrate the swapping the fields of two structures using pointers


L2 Activities:

1. Data Parser:
   A data logger transmits the data in ascii format as shown below
   "S1-T:36.5-H:100-L:50"
   Write a function to populate all the data in an array of structure. The output should be like
   Sensor Info:
   ---------------------
   Sensor ID: S1
   Temperature: 36.5 C
   Humidity: 100
   Light Intensity: 50%
   ---------------------

2. Write a program to enter to Cartesian coordinate points and display the distance between them.

3. Implement structures to read, write and compute average- marks and the students scoring above
   and below the average marks for a class of N students.

4. Write a program to pass a pointer to a structure as a parameter to a function and return back a pointer to structure 
   to the calling function after modifying the members of structure.
