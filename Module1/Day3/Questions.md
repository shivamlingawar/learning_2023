Level-1:

1. Patern Generator:
Write a program to print the given pattern below using 3 functions (1st to accept n and to print from 1 to n, 2nd to accept n and print spaces in between, 3rd to accept the n and print from n to 1)
1234554321
1234    4321
123        321
12            21
1                1

Concepts to be used.
- Loops

 

2. Prints Bits:
Scan a 32bit integer and prints its bits.

Concepts to be used.
- Loops
- Bitwise Operators

 

4. Find the largest number by deleting single digit in a 4 digit number 5872 - 872, 9856 - 986

Concepts to be used.
- Loops
- Operators

 

5. Write a program to find both smallest and largest digits in given n numbers
For example let's say we have n = 3, and n1 = 8, n2 = 156, n3 = 123450, the result will be "Not Valid", 1 and 6, 0 and 5

DS1307 has its time registers in BCD format as shown in the image found in the above link, so 
a. Write a function to Set, clear and toggle bit of an 8-bit number

Concepts to be used.
- Operators

 

2. BCD to Decimal:

DS1307 has its time registers in BCD format as shown in the image found in the above link, To set the time we need to convert the decimal number to BCD format, hence, write a fucntion to convert decimal to BCD

Concepts to be used.
- Operators
- Preprocessor
