Level-1:
1. Assume User will be providing input in the form of a string as show below. 
Write a function to parse the string and initialize an array of structures. 

Example String : "1001 Aron 100.00" 
Example Structure : 
    struct Student{
        int rollno;
        char name[20];
        float marks;
    };

Note: User must be able define the no. of inputs/size of the array during runtime.

2. Write a function to initialize all members in the above array of structures

3. Write a function to display all members in the above array of structures

4. Write a function to sort the array of structures in descending order based on marks 

5. Write a function to perform a search operation on the array of structures based on name of the student

 

Level-2:
1. Write a function to add a member at the end of the above array of structures
Note : Code must use Dynamic Memory concept

2. Write a function to delete a member at the start of the above array of structures
Note : Code must use Dynamic Memory concept

3. Write a function to swap 2 members in different indexes (based on user input) in the above array of structures

3. Write a function to rotate the above array of structures by K positions
